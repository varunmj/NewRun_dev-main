# University Logo & Profile Security Fixes

## Problems Addressed

### 1. **University Logo Not Loading for Non-NIU Universities**
**Problem**: The logo would appear for Northern Illinois University (NIU) but disappear when changed to other universities like University of Texas at Dallas (UTD).

**Root Cause**: The `clearbitLogo.js` utility only had domain mappings for NIU. When a user changed to a different university, the domain couldn't be resolved properly, so the Clearbit API URL would be malformed (e.g., `https://logo.clearbit.com/universityoftexasatdallas.edu` instead of `https://logo.clearbit.com/utdallas.edu`).

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive university domain mappings in `OVERRIDES` object for 50+ universities
- Improved the `nameToDomain()` function to intelligently handle multi-word university names
- Now handles variations like "University of Texas at Dallas" â†’ "utdallas.edu"

### 2. **Security Issue: University Field Manually Editable**
**Problem**: Users could edit the university name in the EditProfileModal after completing onboarding, allowing them to access any university's information.

**Root Cause**: The university field had no access restrictions - it was a regular editable input.

**Solution**: 
- Disabled the university input field in EditProfileModal
- Added visual lock icon (ðŸ”’) to indicate it's protected
- Added hover tooltip explaining "Set during onboarding - cannot be changed manually"
- Changed styling to show it's disabled (opacity, darker background, cursor: not-allowed)

### 3. **University Data Not Being Captured During Onboarding**
**Problem**: While the backend was saving university data, the onboarding flow wasn't explicitly capturing it in Step 4 (University Selection).

**Solution**:
- Backend already properly stores university in `/save-onboarding` endpoint (lines 2461-2463 in backend/index.js)
- University is saved to both `user.university` AND `user.onboardingData.university`
- This ensures data persistence and correct retrieval

## Files Modified

### 1. `/frontend/src/utils/clearbitLogo.js`
**Changes Made:**
- Expanded `OVERRIDES` object from 1 entry to 50+ university domain mappings
- Improved `nameToDomain()` function with better parsing logic
- Now supports both full names (e.g., "University of Texas at Dallas") and abbreviations (e.g., "UT Dallas", "UTD")
- Handles common name variations automatically

**Key Mappings Added:**
```javascript
"university of texas at dallas": "utdallas.edu",
"ut dallas": "utdallas.edu",
"university of texas at austin": "utexas.edu",
"university of chicago": "uchicago.edu",
"stanford university": "stanford.edu",
"harvard university": "harvard.edu",
[... 45+ more ...]
```

### 2. `/frontend/src/components/EditProfileModal/EditProfileModal.tsx`
**Changes Made:**
- University field now has `disabled={true}`
- Changed styling to indicate disabled state
- Added lock icon (ðŸ”’) next to label
- Added lock icon overlay on field
- Added hover tooltip explaining why field is locked

**Visual Changes:**
```tsx
<input
  {...register("university")}
  disabled={true}
  className="... opacity-70 cursor-not-allowed ..."
/>
// + Lock icon
// + Hover tooltip: "Set during onboarding - cannot be changed manually"
```

## Data Flow

### Onboarding Process
1. **Step 4**: User enters/selects their university
2. **Completion**: Data sent to `/save-onboarding` endpoint
3. **Backend**: Saves to `user.university` and `user.onboardingData.university`
4. **Database**: Data persisted with university domain locked

### Profile Display
1. User opens their profile
2. ProfileCard component displays with university name
3. MatchCard renders university badge using `getUniversityLogoUrl()`
4. Logo URL properly resolved with new domain mappings
5. Clearbit API returns correct logo

### Profile Editing
1. User clicks "Edit Profile"
2. EditProfileModal opens with pre-filled data
3. University field shows locked (disabled, with visual indicators)
4. User cannot change university
5. Other profile fields remain editable

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Verify NIU logo still loads correctly
- [x] Verify UT Dallas logo loads when university changed
- [x] Verify university field is disabled in edit modal
- [x] Verify lock icon displays on university field
- [x] Verify hover tooltip shows on lock icon
- [x] Verify onboarding saves university to database
- [x] Verify logo caching works across page refreshes
- [x] Test with various university names and abbreviations

## Backend Support (Already Implemented)

The backend at `/save-onboarding` endpoint:
- âœ… Receives university name from onboarding form
- âœ… Stores in `user.university` field
- âœ… Stores in `user.onboardingData.university` field
- âœ… Persists to database

```javascript
if (onboardingData.university) {
  userDoc.university = onboardingData.university;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sync all university mappings**: Update `RoommateMatches.jsx` and `UserProfile.jsx` to use the same domain mapping utility
2. **Backend university validation**: Add validation to ensure only whitelisted universities can be set
3. **Analytics**: Track university logo load success/failure rates
4. **Admin dashboard**: Allow admins to add new university domain mappings without code changes

## Browser Compatibility

All changes use standard web APIs and CSS features compatible with:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: University domain lookup is synchronous string mapping
- **Improved**: Logo caching now works for all universities, not just NIU
- **No network calls added**: Uses existing Clearbit logo service
