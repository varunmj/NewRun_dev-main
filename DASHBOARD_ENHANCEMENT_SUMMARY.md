## 📊 Response Structure

The enhanced API now returns:

```json
{
  "userSummary": { /* User info and activity digest */ },
  "myProperties": { 
    "items": [ /* Latest properties */ ],
    "statistics": { /* Property metrics */ }
  },
  "myMarketplace": {
    "items": [ /* Latest marketplace items */ ],
    "statistics": { /* Marketplace metrics */ }
  },
  "communityInteractions": { /* Recent community activity */ },
  "solveThreads": { /* Thread history and stats */ },
  "recentSearches": { /* Search activity */ },
  "likes": { /* Like metrics and recent activity */ },
  "roommateRequests": { /* Sent and received requests */ },
  "needsAttention": [ /* Items needing user action */ ],
  "messagesPreview": [ /* Recent conversations */ ],
  "campusPulse": [ /* Latest campus activity */ ],
  "profileProgress": { /* User profile completion */ }
}
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Data Fetching**: All database queries run simultaneously
2. **Result Limiting**: Sensible limits on data returned (6-10 items per section)
3. **Lean Queries**: Reduced memory footprint with `.lean()`
4. **Efficient Aggregations**: Single queries for statistics
5. **Proper Indexing**: Optimized database queries
